*  <h2>[Tacotron - 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884)</h2> 
A tacotron model is trained. Experments with generation of speech using this models is found on [<i>Tacotron Demo.ipynb</i>](https://github.com/hansonrobotics/Tacotron-2/blob/master/Tacotron%20Demo.ipynb) notebook.
<h3> Requirements</h3>
* logs-Tacotron directory - Contains trained  models
---
* <h2>Graffin-lim algorithm</h2>

Contains experments on trainable graffin-lim algorithm. 
* [Experments](https://github.com/hansonrobotics/Tacotron-2/blob/master/Experiments%20on%20Griffin.ipynb)
* [Speech syntheis](https://github.com/hansonrobotics/Tacotron-2/blob/master/griffin_lim_synthesis_tool.ipynb)

* <h2> Waveglow </h2>
WaveGlow: Flow based generative network for speech syntesis
https://github.com/NVIDIA/waveglow
The notebook is about generating speech audio using the pretrained waveglow model.
The process to run the generation is listed on the notebook.
Two notebooks are availale for two diffrent commits.
